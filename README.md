- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jobenriquez. I am currently a computer science student at a public university in the Philippines. I am learning Spanish at the moment, but I can already speak Filipino and English (C!).
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computers, gaming, and technology in general.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to program in C and Python. I learnt basic C during my first year in college. Additionally, I also am practising making User Interfaces.
